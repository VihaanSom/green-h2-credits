# Green H2 Credits â€“ Hardhat & TypeScript Project

This project implements a Green Hydrogen Credits system using Ethereum smart contracts, built with Hardhat and TypeScript. It provides a framework for developing, testing, and deploying Solidity contracts for green hydrogen credit issuance, tracking, and verification.

## Project Overview

This repository includes:

- **Solidity Smart Contracts:** Located in the `contracts/` directory, these define the core business logic for green H2 credits.
- **TypeScript Scripting & Testing:** Scripts and tests leveraging TypeChain-generated types for safe contract interaction.
- **Hardhat Configuration:** Customizable and extendable via `hardhat.config.ts`.
- **Deployment Modules:** The `ignition/` directory contains Ignition modules for deployment automation to various networks (local, Sepolia, etc.).
- **Automation Scripts:** The `scripts/` directory holds scripts for tasks like deployment, minting, or custom contract interactions.
- **Automated Tests:** The `test/` directory includes unit and integration tests for both contracts and scripts.
- **TypeChain Types:** Strongly-typed contract interfaces generated in `typechain-types/` for seamless TypeScript development.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Build TypeScript

```shell
npm run build
```

### Compile Contracts

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

Tests are located in the `test/` directory and may include both Solidity and TypeScript-based tests.

### Deploying Contracts

#### Local Deployment

To deploy a contract module (for example, from `ignition/modules/Counter.ts`) to a local Hardhat chain:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

#### Sepolia Testnet Deployment

To deploy to Sepolia, you need a funded account and must set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` configuration variable. This can be done via the `hardhat-keystore` plugin or by setting an environment variable.

Set via keystore:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

Then deploy:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

### Scripts

You can add and run automation scripts from the `scripts/` directory using Hardhat's scripting functionality. See individual script files for instructions.

## Directory Structure

```
contracts/         # Solidity smart contracts for Green H2 Credits
scripts/           # Automation scripts for deployment and interaction
test/              # Unit and integration tests
ignition/          # Ignition modules for automated deployments
typechain-types/   # TypeScript typings generated by TypeChain
hardhat.config.ts  # Hardhat configuration
```
